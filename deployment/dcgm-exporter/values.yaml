# Comment the following line to stop profiling metrics from DCGM
arguments: ["-f", "/etc/dcgm-exporter/dcp-metrics-included.csv"]
# NOTE: in general, add any command line arguments to arguments above
# and they will be passed through.
# Use "-r", "<HOST>:<PORT>" to connect to an already running hostengine
# Example arguments: ["-r", "host123:5555"]
# Use "-n" to remove the hostname tag from the output.
# Example arguments: ["-n"]
# Use "-d" to specify the devices to monitor. -d must be followed by a string
# in the following format: [f] or [g[:numeric_range][+]][i[:numeric_range]]
# Where a numeric range is something like 0-4 or 0,2,4, etc.
# Example arguments: ["-d", "g+i"] to monitor all GPUs and GPU instances or
# ["-d", "g:0-3"] to monitor GPUs 0-3.
